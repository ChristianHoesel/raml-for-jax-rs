## Generation plugins
The generation plugins have been broken in two:  for the generation plugins related to RAML types, please
see the [raml-to-pojo](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-java-tools/) project.

For the raml-to-jaxrs annotations, they are:
```raml
annotationTypes:
    resources:
        allowedTargets: [Resource, Method, Response, API]
        properties:
            plugins?: any[]
    methods:
        allowedTargets: [Method, API]
        properties:
            plugins?: any[]

    responseClasses:
        allowedTargets: [Method, API]
        properties:
            plugins?: any[]

    responses:
        allowedTargets: [Response, API]
        properties:
            plugins?: any[]
```

**They have changed from 2.x to 3.x **.  

All the interception classes are located [here](src/main/java/org/raml/jaxrs/generator/extension/resources/api).
The classes/interfaces/methods are generated by [JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet).
Each method should return the `*.Builder` that was passed to it OR
a new one built by the method.  Returning an null builder should suppress the method or class generated, but would 
probably break the RAML contract.

### Using the generation plugins
An example project showcasing these plugins is documented [here](../examples/maven-examples/features/README.md).

### When to use the generation plugins
There are several use-cases listed and explained [here](../examples/maven-examples/features/USE_CASES.MD).
